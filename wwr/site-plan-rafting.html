        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose for our river rafting website is to bring attention to our thrill seeking adventurers that are looking to explore the outdoors. Our company aims to provide excitement through the natural beauty of the river showcased by the tour guides on our river rafting tours. This website is here to provide knowledge of the trip packages we provide, safety protocols that must be followed and a brief description of the knowledge our tour guides will share along the river. The site will offer the information to plan the most exhilarating white water rating experience they desire.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience is a mix of ages. We have a family package that offers a calm water float with mild rapids. This is for the families that are looking to get out from the cities and enjoy some fun while on Holiday. Then we have the White water Rapids that are for the more athletic and adrenaline seeking individuals or groups. These would be people that are seeking high action in their daily lives. All are seeking an exhilirating time that will be provided to them through their own custom picked packages. 
        They expect to find information about the river, how long of a trip it will be, estimated costs. They will also being seeking location information and travel requirements. They may not find information on local companies that provide transportation to the facility.
